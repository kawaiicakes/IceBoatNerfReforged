Stops boats from moving fast on ice.

## **ðŸ“– Information**
Stop boats from gliding at mach 30 on ice. Instead feel the unsatisfying tactile and auditory assault of wooden paddles scraping against ice. <br>
Written because the only version in Forge 1.19.2 that I am aware of is bundled with quark. Sorry, Vazkii </3
